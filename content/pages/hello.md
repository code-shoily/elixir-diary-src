After admiring Elixir from a distance for a while, I'm finally learning it.

I love collecting programming languages. Python was the first language I learnt on my own, back in school. It wasn't taught there, no assignments or grade points were attached with it, and it was fun. I still remember the whoa-s I had when I first discovered the REPL, dynamic typing, and regular expressions. Since then I kept an open mind about new programming languages.

One thing I noticed is, the more languages I get acquinted with, the more *questions* I learn to ask when learning a new one (i.e. *How does the else-if look like here?*, *How do I define a anonymous function?*, *Does it have pattern matching?*, *Wait, no exception handling?*). I **do** make a note of emptying my cup though, there's no fun learning a new language if you don't start with the immortal `Hello World`. So I end up writing some codes, talking with my peers about it, making things with it, sneaking it at my work place, or just leaving it with a *sigh*. I think it would be fun writing my experiences *while* I'm learning a language and the cup is still empty: raw thoughts, raw codes, lots of bloopers!

I tend to pick on one language a year. This year, I picked Go. A nifty little language that reminded me back of the school days. Then I stumbled upon a reddit post that was talking about Elixir and the people and their comments seemed nice. So I checked the homepage and read up. Installed and coded `1+1` too. I loved it how Elixir made me think. So after wasting a few weeks just reading up, this Friday I decided I'd break the one language per year rule and just get started with Elixir, and for what's written on the previous paragraph, **Write about it too**. Nothing fancy or sophisticated though, I'll just fire up the shell, open an editor, the manual, and write whatever emotions I'm getting hit with. I'm sure I'll come back here and laugh about it in the future.

Let's hope I don't laugh too much though.
