This is where I place all the links that helped my during my exploration of Elixir.

* [Elixir Homepage](http://elixir-lang.org/) These guys have really good documentation.
* [/r/elixir/](https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir) The subreddit dedicated to Elixir
* [Elixir Style Guide](https://github.com/niftyn8/elixir_style_guide)
* [Awesome Elixir](https://github.com/h4cc/awesome-elixir) This is what makes this link redundant.

I will keep this link updated with whatever I find during the course of time :)
